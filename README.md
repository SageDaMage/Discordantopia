# Discordantopia

Welcome, traveler, to Armada, a spaceport like no other! 

A setting supplement for both [Pulka](https://ozbrowning.itch.io/pulka) and [Troika](https://melsonian-arts-council.itch.io/troika-numinous-edition), Discordantopia presents a "[Dystopian-punk Spelljammer](https://twitter.com/SageCraft03/status/1484747564163420161?s=20&t=7hiCmc5M0pIM0s1WVKtuyw)" city that you can make your own!

_**Why should I back this?**_

Discordantopia's profits during Zine Month are ALL going to the production of the zine, whether that be [AndyAnimates](https://andyanimates.itch.io/)' amazing caricatures or [Tony Dowler](https://twitter.com/tonydowler)'s awesome maps! In addition, regardless of how well the itchfunding does, I guarantee I finished product. There's no failure here, only succeeding BETTER!

_**What do I get by backing it early?**_

You will get WIP documents and access to my private discord server where you can get frequent progress updates (and potentially join in playtests from there)!

_**What is in Discordantopia?**_

Within this zine, on the player's side, will be eight Pulka/Troika compatible backgrounds, a brief player's guide with [Cairn](https://yochaigal.itch.io/cairn)-esque player agendas/principles to ensure everyone is on the page in regards to the setting, and thought-provoking character creation questions to get everyone invested at the table.

On the GM's side, similar agendas/principles, a how-to on maneuvering through the book and utilizing it to its fullest, and a full guide on Armada, the city in which Discordantopia is set.

What sets apart Discordantopia from other setting books is its focus being specific but open. Think [Electric Bastionland](https://chrismcdee.itch.io/electric-bastionland)'s implied setting, mixed with leading questions for the GM to fill in the blanks, as well as evocative yet concise descriptions for each location.

_**What are the funding goals?**_

Unless itâ€™s already been met, please note that all of the goals below are subject to refinement/reorganizing, though the core should stay, barring exceptional circumstances.

**Background Art x8 - $340 ($340 Total) - FUNDED!**

**NPC Portraits x5 - $266 ($606 Total) - FUNDED!**

**Wrap-Around Cover - $161 ($767 Total) - FUNDED!**

**\*:** Just based on an instant quote I got from Mixam, could potentially start printing for less if I dip into my own funds or get outside support.
